                            With a foundation in the banking industry and Wall Street, our founders saw firsthand how small businesses struggled to access funding through traditional financial channels. This inspired them to establish Shore Funding Solutions in 2014, with a small but dedicated team based in Melville, NY. From these modest beginnings, we’ve grown to a team of 80 professionals. Along the way, we’ve facilitated over $1 billion in funding, and our dedication to empowering businesses with financial solutions remains at the core of our continued success.
